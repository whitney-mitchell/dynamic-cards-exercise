 ---Single Page Apps, and JavaScript Event Listeners
 Completed May 2016
### [Live Demo!](http://whitney-mitchell.github.io/dynamic-cards-exercise/)

Exercise assigned during the front-end portion of the Nashville Software School curriculum.
Designed to give students experience dynamically adding and removing elements from the DOM through use of event listeners. Students were expected to use only vanilla JavaScript. While I met the requirements for the assignment, I also took the opportunity to experiment with some over the top CSS. The requirements students were given are as follows:
```
###Instructions

1. Create an HTML page that contains a text area and a button labeled "Create."
2. When the user enters in text into the text area and then clicks the create button, create a new card element in the DOM. You decide the height/width of the card.
3. When the user clicks the Delete button, the containing card, and no other cards, should then be removed from the DOM. Not just made invisible, actually removed from the DOM.
